# mfv.dev — Personal Website & Portfolio

Welcome to **mfv.dev**, my personal website and interactive portfolio.  
This site is both a **presentation layer** for my work and an **experimentation space** where I explore modern frontend patterns, animation, and UI systems.

It is designed to reflect how I think about **engineering, systems, and product polish**—not just static content.

🌐 **Live Site:** https://mfv.dev

## ✨ Purpose & Vision

This website serves multiple goals:

- Present my **professional background**, skills, and projects
- Showcase my ability to build **modern, animated, production-ready UIs**
- Act as a sandbox for experimenting with **new web technologies**
- Demonstrate attention to **performance, structure, and UX**

Rather than a traditional résumé page, the site leans toward a **systems-driven, interactive experience** inspired by sci-fi HUDs, game UI, and technical dashboards.
